### Hi there! I'm Fangü¶Å

I'm a web developer that has a passion for building applications in the JAM (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) stack. In particular, using Serverless tech and Node.js. I'm always learning more about JavaScript in no small part thanks to these.

I love the modern web and its amazingly productive tooling. For some specifics of my stack I've used React and Gatsby, so I've been in the React ecosystem, but have taken a great interest in Svelte. Sapper, Elder.js, Routify, you name it. `await`ing Svelte Kit especially since it'll integrate beautifully with my stack.  Svelte does lack a larger ecosystem, but as any Svelte developer will tell you... The satisfaction from using it is off the charts. People are missing out, but if I'm being honest I'll still be a surprised Pikachu if it takes the frontend world by storm. 

While I have no qualms with using my favorite database FaunaDB, with FQL and GraphQL, I do acknowledge that most of my efforts are spent in the frontend. Fauna just makes the database setup too quick. 

My preferred platform is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Real time saver that has tons of impressive features baked in, check them out if you haven't heard of them! Plus, they're the definitive JAM stack platform. As they say, keep on spreading the JAM! 

### Chingu Voyages & Web Development

I learn through [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/), which allows me to collaborate with people who have the same goals of learning more about web development and furthering their skills through projects. This has pushed and greatly accelerated my learning, and has given me new perspectives on team productivity as well as an idea on how others learn, work, and write their code. 

I've partaken four 6-week voyages so far, here're some of them:  
[**üìÉ Toucan Recipes**](https://toucanrecipes.netlify.app/) [(v20-toucans-team-01)](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v20-toucans-team-01)  - A JAM stack recipe app using React, Gatsby, and Chakra-UI.  
[**‚òï Bear Coffee**](https://bearcoffee.netlify.app/) [(v24-bears-team-05)](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v24-bears-team-05)  - A JAM stack free e-commerce demo using Svelte, Elder.js, and Stripe.
