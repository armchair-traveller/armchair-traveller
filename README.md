### Hi there! I'm Fangü¶Å

I'm a web developer that has a passion for building applications in the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) (JavaScript, APIs, Markup). My area of focus is [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Serverless](https://serverless.css-tricks.com/about/) tech (Node.js, Fauna). I'm always learning more about JavaScript in no small part thanks to these.

I love the modern web and its amazingly productive tooling. 

### Tech / Uses

I proactively seek technologies that excite me, whether through how they solve my pain points, better my workflow, or improve team productivity. Even if a particular technology is not exciting to me, I make sure to learn about things that are gaining momentum in the web development world so I can keep up (and in the off-chance that they have a perfect use case for what I do).

<summary>Specifics</summary>
To that end I've used React and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (w/ the very robust [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)) so I've been in the React ecosystem, but have moved onto Svelte. [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), [Elder.js](https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/), [Routify](https://routify.dev/), you name it. Currently using [Svelte Kit](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit).  Svelte does lack a larger ecosystem, but as any Svelte developer will tell you... The satisfaction from using it is off the charts. People are missing out.

My favorite database is [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) as it is truly a pleasure to work with in a serverless context. Fauna Query Language is very flexible and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is so much fun... It's just that since Fauna makes database work go by so quick, I can only spend most of my time in the frontend. Literal suffering from success.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is my platform of choice. Real time saver that has tons of impressive features baked in, give them a try if you're ready to be mind-blown ü§Ø Plus, they're the definitive Jamstack platform. As they say, keep on spreading the jam!

### Chingu Voyages & Web Development

I challenge my skills through [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/), which allows me to collaborate with people who have the same goals of learning more about web development and furthering their skills through building projects. This has pushed and greatly accelerated my learning, and has given me new perspectives on team productivity as well as an idea on how others learn, work, and write their code.

I've partaken five 6-week voyages so far, here're some of them:  
[**üéº Bear Class**](https://bearclass.netlify.app/) [v26-bears-team-07](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v26-bears-team-07) - A Google Classroom clone using Svelte, Routify, and GraphQL w/ FaunaDB.  
[**üìÉ Toucan Recipes**](https://toucanrecipes.netlify.app/) [(v20-toucans-team-01)](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v20-toucans-team-01)  - A Jamstack recipe app using React, Gatsby, and Chakra-UI.  
[**‚òï Bear Coffee**](https://bearcoffee.netlify.app/) [(v24-bears-team-05)](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v24-bears-team-05)  - A free e-commerce demo using Svelte, Elder.js, and Stripe.
