### Hi there! I'm Fangü¶Å

I'm a front end web developer that has a passion for building applications in the JAM (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) stack. In particular, using Serverless tech and Node.js. I'm always learning more about JavaScript thanks to it.

I love the modern web and its amazingly productive tooling. Some specifics of my stack, I've used React + Gatsby, and more recently Svelte + Elder.js / Svelte Kit. Really hoping that Svelte takes off because all it lacks is a larger ecosystem and you're missing out if you haven't tried Svelte yet! Nifty stuff.

My preferred platform is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Real time saver that has tons of impressive features baked in, check them out if you haven't heard of them! (Plus, they're the definitive JAM stack platform) 

### Chingu Voyages & Web Development

I learn through [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/), which allows me to collaborate with people who have the same goals of learning more about web development and furthering their skills through projects. This has pushed and greatly accelerated my learning, and has given me new perspectives on team productivity, as well as an idea on how others learn, work, and write their code. 

I've partaken four 6-week voyages so far, here're some of them:  
[**üìÉ Toucan Recipes**](https://toucanrecipes.netlify.app/) [(v20-toucans-team-01)](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v20-toucans-team-01)  - A JAM stack recipe app using React, Gatsby, and Chakra-UI.  
[**‚òï Bear Coffee**](https://bearcoffee.netlify.app/) [(v24-bears-team-05)](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v24-bears-team-05)  - A JAM stack free e-commerce demo using Svelte, Elder.js, and Stripe.
