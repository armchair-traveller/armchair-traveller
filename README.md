### Hi there! I'm Fangü¶Å

## I haven't met a team that wasn't satisfied with my work

And that's because it's backed by a comprehensive background in front-end development: from building foundational component primitives and design systems to maintaining complex codebases. I‚Äôve crafted landing pages from scratch, transformed polished designs into high-performance web apps, and architected scalable frontends for tens of thousands of users. Beyond the UI, I‚Äôve also tackled backend tasks‚Äîdeploying serverless applications, engineering payment systems, and bridging design with backend seamlessly.

My secret? I'm always ready to bring this blend of creativity and technical precision to new challenges. Design? Development? Doesn't matter, I'll do what it takes to get the job done right. 

### Tech / Uses

I proactively seek technologies that excite me, particularly ones that allow me to ship faster, solve my pain points, or perfect my workflow. That propogates to every single team I work with. I make sure to learn all there is that's gaining momentum in the web development world. Because that's how I do my work as an engineer, better!


### Web Development

I challenge my skills through [Chingu.io](https://www.chingu.io/), which allows me to collaborate with people who have the same goals of learning more about web development and furthering their skills through building projects. We do things in the Agile *mythology*. It has pushed and greatly accelerated my learning, and has given me new perspectives on team productivity as well as an idea on how others learn, work, and write their code. A big part of my growth. Well, besides all the other projects I've notched under NDA.

I've partaken seven 6-week voyages so far
