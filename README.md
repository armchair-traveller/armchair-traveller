## Hi there! I'm Fang

### Building

A non-exhaustive list of what I do: landing pages, web apps, data visualization, APIs, component libraries, primitives, design systems, screenshot-driven design, copywriting, architecture, payments.

I love front. back. design. marketing. product. I lean frontend, but solving problems is above all.

That, and building anything that scratches an itch.

### Tech

> *"Good teams use good tools"ยน*

I live in VS Code / Figma.

Modern scalable, architectures.

Keep updated. The tech isn't everything, but being better excites me. Free up resources thinking about common issues so that you can focus on the hard problems and avoid the regret of work not reaching the quality it should have.

*Ship faster. Solve pain points. Propogate to your team. Do better.*
