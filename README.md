### Hi there! I'm Fangü¶Å

I am a front end web developer that has a passion for building applications in the JAM (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) stack with Serverless tech. The JAM stack really emphasizes how all-powerful JavaScript has become! Even though my skills primarily lie in front end, I also know a bit of Node.js because **It's Just JavaScript**‚Ñ¢ and it's such an influential piece of technology that is crucial for modern web development workflows, even in the front end.

I can't help loving the modern web and its amazingly productive tooling. I've used React with Gatsby, and more recently Svelte with Sapper. Really hoping that Svelte takes off because all it lacks is a larger ecosystem and you're missing out if you haven't tried Svelte yet! Nifty stuff.

Oh, and my deploys are done through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Real time saver that has tons of impressive features baked in, check them out if you haven't heard of them!

### Chingu Voyages & Web Development

I participate in [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) projects on a regular basis to collaborate with people who have the same goals of learning more about web development and furthering their skills. This has pushed and greatly accelerated my learning, and has given me new perspectives on team productivity, as well as an idea on how others write their code. Completed two 6-week voyages so far: v14 and [v20-toucans-team-01](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v20-toucans-team-01). I am currently in [v22-geckos-team-03](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v22-geckos-team-03).

### What I'm currently doing

üå± Learning [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/), so that I can have a nice database for my Serverless needs. It's very robust and FQL (Fauna Query Language) appeals to my functional programming tendencies. Especially interested in how it handles auth/RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), so that I can link it up to Netlify Identity and write some CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) applications in the JAM stack.
