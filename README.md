## Hi there! I'm Fangü¶Å

### And I haven't met a team that wasn't satisfied with my work

That's because it's backed by a comprehensive background in front-end development: from building foundational component primitives and design systems to maintaining complex codebases. I‚Äôve crafted landing pages from scratch, transformed polished designs into high-performance web apps, and architected scalable frontends for tens of thousands of users. Beyond the UI, I‚Äôve also tackled backend tasks‚Äîdeploying serverless applications, engineering payment systems, and bridging design with backend seamlessly.

My secret? I'm always ready to bring this blend of creativity and technical precision to new challenges. Design? Development? Doesn't matter, if you want something done right, do it yourself. 

### Tech / Uses

I proactively seek technologies that excite me, particularly ones that allow me to ship faster, solve my pain points, or perfect my workflow. That propogates to every single team I work with. I make sure to learn all there is that's gaining momentum in the web development world. Because that's how I do my work as an engineer, better!
