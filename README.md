### Hi there! I'm Fangü¶Å

I'm a web developer that has a fire lit inside for building fullstack applications in the [**Jamstack**](https://jamstack.org/) (JavaScript, APIs, Markup). I know a thing or two about JavaScript. The tools in my belt aren't really cutting edge, just [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Serverless](https://serverless.css-tricks.com/about/), but I'm very satisfied with the development experience that they bring to the table. They bring a refreshing simplicity to full stack development.

In my spare time I tend to mess around with playwright and dabble with design. 

### Tech / Uses

I proactively seek technologies that excite me, whether through how they solve my pain points or better my workflow. That propogates to teams I work with. I make sure to learn about things that are gaining momentum in the web development world so that I can do my work as a developer better. Why? I just want to deliver more in less time.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Specifics</strong></summary>
  I've like to employ a variety of stacks and learn whatever I need. <strong>Currently</strong>...

  <p>
    As aforementioned I heavily use Svelte, and while it does lack the maturity of a larger
    ecosystem Svelte developers will tell you that the satisfaction from
    using it is off the charts. People are missing out. I utilize <a
      href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Svelte Kit</a
    > as my main web app framework because of its powerful modern workflow. Its concept 
    of adapters allows it to be a static site generator and/or full stack serverless
    framework depending on the project's needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    My favorite database is <a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> as it is
    truly a pleasure to work with in a serverless context. Fauna Query Language
    is very flexible and
    <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is so much fun... It's just that since
    Fauna makes database work go by so quick, I can only spend most of my time in
    the frontend. Literal suffering from success.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mainly deploy my Jamstack projects through <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>. For backend oriented projects I use Cloudflare Workers which operates on V8 isolates (although I just use Node if no online functionality is required).
  </p>

  These are some that I no longer actively peruse, in chronological order, because
  I'm using other tools that serve similar purposes (but I still love them!):

  <ol>
    <li>
      React & <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> +
      <a href="https://chakra-ui.com/">Chakra-UI</a> ‚Äî I've been in the React ecosystem,
      but have moved onto Svelte & Svelte Kit + TailwindCSS as my main frontend/fullstack
      tool as I feel it's much easier to reason with.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>,
      <a href="https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/">Elder.js</a>,
      <a href="https://routify.dev/">Routify</a>. As mentioned, I currently
      build most everything in Svelte Kit due to its usage of an unbundler
      (Vite).
    </li>
  </ol>

### Web Development

I challenge my skills through [Chingu.io](https://www.chingu.io/), which allows me to collaborate with people who have the same goals of learning more about web development and furthering their skills through building projects. We do things in the Agile *mythology*. It has pushed and greatly accelerated my learning, and has given me new perspectives on team productivity as well as an idea on how others learn, work, and write their code. A big part of my growth.

I've partaken six 6-week voyages so far, here're some of them (partially pinned):  
[**üöÄ DShift**](https://dshift.netlify.app/) [v28-svelte-team-09](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v28-svelte-team-09) ‚Äî A blazing fast shift management web app sporting a surprisingly simple interface. Built w/ Svelte Kit & Tailwind.  
[**üéº Bear Class**](https://bearclass.netlify.app/) [v26-bears-team-07](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v26-bears-team-07) ‚Äî A Google Classroom clone using Svelte, Routify, and GraphQL w/ FaunaDB.  
[**üìÉ Toucan Recipes**](https://toucanrecipes.netlify.app/) [v20-toucans-team-01](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v20-toucans-team-01)  ‚Äî A Jamstack recipe app using React, Gatsby, and Chakra-UI.  
[**‚òï Bear Coffee**](https://bearcoffee.netlify.app/) [v24-bears-team-05](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v24-bears-team-05)  ‚Äî A free e-commerce demo using Svelte, Elder.js, and Stripe.
