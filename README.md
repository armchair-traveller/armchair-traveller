### Hi there! I'm Fang

I am a front end web developer that has a passion for building applications in the JAM stack with Serverless tech! That said, I also know a bit of Node.js because It's Just JavaScriptâ„¢

I can't help loving the modern web and how powerful JavaScript has become. I've used React with Gatsby and more recently Svelte with Sapper. Really hoping that Svelte takes off because all it lacks is a larger ecosystem and you're missing out if you haven't tried Svelte yet! Some very impressive stuff. Nifty.

### Chingu Voyages

I participate in [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) projects on a regular basis to work with people who have the same goals of learning more about web development. Completed two 6-week voyages so far: v14 and [v20-toucans-team-01](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v20-toucans-team-01) and am currently in [v22-geckos-team-03](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v22-geckos-team-03).
