## Hi there! I'm Fangü¶Å

### Serial builder.

Sometimes, I'm a bridge.

A non-exhaustive list of what I build: landing pages, web apps, data visualization, APIs, component libraries, primitives, design systems, screenshot-driven design, copywriting, code architecture, payment systems.

I love front. back. design. marketing. business. Sure, I lean frontend, but in the end, all about product. Why pick just one?

I have to build. I can‚Äôt stop. Gotta go fast.

(Also, I‚Äôm way too hungry to finish writing this, but thanks for reading. Have a good one.)

### Tech / Uses

I live in VSCode / Figma.

Modern scalable, architectures. Good teams use good tools. 

Better tech excites me. Ship faster. Solve pain points. That propogates to every single team I work with. Because that's how I do my work, better!
