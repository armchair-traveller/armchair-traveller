### Hi there! I'm Fangü¶Å

I'm a web developer that has a passion for building applications in the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) (JavaScript, APIs, Markup). My area of focus is [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Serverless](https://serverless.css-tricks.com/about/) tech. I'm always learning more about JavaScript in no small part thanks to these.

I love the modern web and its amazingly productive tooling. 

### Tech / Uses

I proactively seek technologies that excite me, whether through how they solve my pain points, better my workflow, or improve team productivity. Even if a particular technology is not exciting to me, I make sure to learn about things that are gaining momentum in the web development world so that I can do my work as a developer better (and in the off-chance that they have a perfect use case for what I do).

<details>
  <summary><strong>Specifics</strong></summary>
  I've built projects in many stacks. <strong>Currently</strong>...

  <p>
    As aforementioned, I heavily use Svelte, and while it does lack the maturity of a larger
    ecosystem any Svelte developer will tell you that the satisfaction from
    using it is off the charts. People are missing out. I utilize <a
      href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Svelte Kit</a
    > as my main web app framework because of its powerful modern workflow. Its concept 
    of adapters allows it to be a static site generator and/or full stack serverless
    framework depending on the project's needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    My favorite database is <a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> as it is
    truly a pleasure to work with in a serverless context. Fauna Query Language
    is very flexible and
    <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is so much fun... It's just that since
    Fauna makes database work go by so quick, I can only spend most of my time in
    the frontend. Literal suffering from success.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is my platform of choice. Real
    time saver that has tons of impressive features baked in, give them a try if
    you're ready to be mind-blown ü§Ø Plus, they're the definitive Jamstack platform.
    As they say, keep on spreading the jam!
  </p>

  These are some that I no longer actively peruse (chronological order) because
  I'm using other tools that serve similar purposes (but I still love them!):

  <ol>
    <li>
      React & <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> +
      <a href="https://chakra-ui.com/">Chakra-UI</a> ‚Äî I've been in the React ecosystem,
      but have moved onto Svelte & Svelte Kit + TailwindCSS as my main frontend/fullstack
      tool as I feel it's much easier to reason with.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>,
      <a href="https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/">Elder.js</a>,
      <a href="https://routify.dev/">Routify</a>. As mentioned, I currently
      build most everything in Svelte Kit due to its usage of an unbundler
      (Vite).
    </li>

### Chingu Voyages & Web Development

I challenge my skills through [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/), which allows me to collaborate with people who have the same goals of learning more about web development and furthering their skills through building projects. This has pushed and greatly accelerated my learning, and has given me new perspectives on team productivity as well as an idea on how others learn, work, and write their code.

I've partaken five 6-week voyages so far, here're some of them:  
[**üéº Bear Class**](https://bearclass.netlify.app/) [v26-bears-team-07](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v26-bears-team-07) - A Google Classroom clone using Svelte, Routify, and GraphQL w/ FaunaDB.  
[**üìÉ Toucan Recipes**](https://toucanrecipes.netlify.app/) [(v20-toucans-team-01)](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v20-toucans-team-01)  - A Jamstack recipe app using React, Gatsby, and Chakra-UI.  
[**‚òï Bear Coffee**](https://bearcoffee.netlify.app/) [(v24-bears-team-05)](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v24-bears-team-05)  - A free e-commerce demo using Svelte, Elder.js, and Stripe.
